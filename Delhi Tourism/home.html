			<font color="green" size="5">Delhi is the capital city of India and is regarded as the heart of the nation. The city is popular for its enriched culture and heritage. The city hosts some famous historical monuments and is developing with the passing of time. The influence of religious diversity can be seen in the city along with the cultural impact of the Mughal, the ancient Indian and the British. There are many beautiful gardens in the city, away from pollution and busy city life that provide opportunities to walk leisurely in the midst of greenery. The capital city is divided into two sections popularly known as Purani Dilli or Old Delhi and Nayi Dilli or New Delhi. Old Delhi is popular for its ancient culture and monuments along with its overcrowded gastronomical lanes.<br />

			Red fort is one of the historic monuments located in Delhi. This monument gets its name from the red colored sandstone used for construction by the Mughals. This fort is located in the center of the city and was used as a ceremonial spot for the royals. Even today, the spot is used for political and national ceremonies. Red fort is not just about the outer beauty of the fortified wall. You can find many interesting attractions inside the fort like palaces, halls, museums and others. </font><br />

			<font color="green" size="5"><font size="5">Humayun's Tomb was built in 1565 A.D. nine years after the death of Humayun, by his senior widow Bega Begam. Inside the walled enclosure the most notable features are the garden squares (chaharbagh) with pathways water channels, centrally located well proportional mausoleum topped by double dome. There are several graves of Mughal rulers located inside the walled enclosure and from here in 1857 A.D; Lieutenant Hudson had captured the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah II. </font><br />

			<font color="green" size="5"><font size="5">The main Minar, as well as the other places and attractions, are imbibed in a complex which is known as the Qutab complex. Believed to be constructed by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak, the 73-meter tall tower has been featured in lots of movies. The place is peaceful and enigmatic. You can nd the tourists, architecture students sketching the perspective views and lots of other people roaming in the complex and still never feel crowded. I have always loved this place from among all the other ones and have spent various long evenings in the quiet corners of the Qutab Minar</font><br />

			<font color="green" size="5"><font size="5">At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an &quot;Arc-de-Triomphe&quot; like archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I. The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919. The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was designed by Edwin Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence. The eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971. </font></font>

While October to March is the best time to visit Delhi in terms of relatively cool weather, some weeks in late November to January should be avoided because of heavy smog cover. February and March have great weather and relatively clean air to travel outside. The summer months (April to July) are scorching hot in Delhi as the temperature might rise to 45 degree Celsius. Temperatures fall a little during the monsoon season (August to September) and certain days can be good for roaming around.
